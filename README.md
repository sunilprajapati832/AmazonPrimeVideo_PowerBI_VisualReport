# 📊 Amazon Prime User Insights Dashboard

This project is a data analysis and visualization report based on a dataset of Amazon Prime users. It originally focused on solving a series of exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I have extended the project by building an interactive Power BI Dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

## 🔍 EDA Questions Solved

This dashboard is based on solving the following questions from the original project:

1. Retrieve the names and email addresses of all users  
2. Find the number of users by gender  
3. Get the usernames and membership start dates of users who joined before a certain date  
4. Count the number of users from a specific location (e.g. Port...)  
5. Subscription plans and their user count  
6. Usernames with payment info  
7. Renewal status of subscriptions  
8. Average usage frequency  
9. Users with specific purchase history  
10. Favorite genres of users and their count  
... _(See full list in `dataset_questions.txt`)_
